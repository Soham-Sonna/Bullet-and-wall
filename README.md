# Bullets And Walls
The Military saw your Car collision project and they were interested in assigning you another
project. They have given you $1000 to test the reliability of walls when bullets hit them.
They test the effectiveness of walls against bullets, amongst other things. All walls are made
of concrete material. If the damage to the wall from the bullet exceeds a certain value, the
material used to make the wall is rejected.
